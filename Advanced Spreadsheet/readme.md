# Advanced Spreadsheets: Project

**How to approach evaluating a spreadsheet template and how to create a data-driven real estate investment strategy, identifying valuable insights.** With this project, you will develop an advanced understanding of spreadsheet functionality as you build a spreadsheet template that incorporates data collection, data filtering, statistical analysis, and financial modeling.

## Part 1 - Explore and Filter the Data

Create a spreadsheet where you can load data using a key to communicate with an external database (e.g. MLS database) in the spreadsheet. Next, explore data availability and reliability and present the data you will use to analyze real estate investments and market conditions of your chosen city.

### Key Considerations

- Some common data you may want to include: ZIP codes, address, property type, sales date, sales price, days on market, year built, and any important feature or upgrade data for the properties.
- Prepare for analysis:
    - Data validation rules to prevent entry of invalid data sets.
    - Use color or formatting rules to represent discrepancies.
    - Pivot Tables.

### Methods

- Use multiple Pivot Tables to visualize total sales sorted by year in the city?
- Can data be pulled from the city's website, and how? Is it available as an API?
- Can we track real estate buying, building occupancy, and the age of buildings using the same data?
- Data cleaning steps:
    - Determine how to ensure MAC addresses with a timestamp correlate with the correct property.
    - Are there any opportunities to cross-check MLS data to ensure accurate data without waiting for a lengthy external API call? How can we use Excel to expedite this?
    - Use geolocation data to ensure the properties are correctly plotted.

## Part 2 - Which type of properties should be targeted?

Investors commonly scramble to identify and prioritize high ROI properties but often find missing data points or misdirected statistics that result in expensive mistakes when buying or renovating property investments.

### Analyzing what kind of data:

- Determine key metrics to check/validate to ensure the real estate investment is profitable:
    - When a property is purchased, are there records to indicate it was inspected, appraised? Is it rent-ready?
    - Was the previous owner known to keep the property well-maintained, e.g., maintenance records for HVAC, appliances, roof (with dates), etc.?
    - Is it in a good neighborhood? Are there indications of well-maintained surrounding homes?

## Part 3 - Calculating occupancy

This region can be seen where there are high possibility of spells. To decide this, it is essential to devise mechanisms of identifying and eliminating dead properties that take up space but do not contribute to profitability. This requires:

- Introducing suitable aggregation by ZIP code, wards, or relevant divisions to ensure accurate representation and analysis of the data.
- Calculate:
    - Factors of improving appeal to the population with a model of zip code, ward to city.
    - Based on time period when the increased demand in population will play its role in city development.

## Part 4 - Estimate revenue for an investment property

Due to large-scale investment, an appropriate evaluation of what you invest in will bring up a wide array of revenue scenarios that you need to ensure a deep dive into opportunities that ensure good returns.

### Step-by-step process of data analysis and valuation:

- Situation: Is a population of 1M in the city?
    - People who buy/rent are typically from what age bracket?
- There is an estimation of people, but how big will this community be? You need to analyze why people would choose this community to invest in, how they will save money, and how easy accessibility to amenities will impact your investment approach.

## Part 5 - Optionalâ€”What attributes are important for a vacation rental?

Items key to optimizing your revenue will be crucial when planning what amenities you should make available, and at what season.

### Gathering good data for feasibility assessment:

- Determine what season peak property rentals are most likely, and optimize your plan to accommodate this.
- Check with local authorities on guidelines for vacation rentals and if the property is zoned for such use.

## Part 6 - Documentation and spreadsheet formatting

Good documentation and presentation is a key component of making a successful business proposal. Here are some guidelines to follow for maintaining clear, readable, and professional documentation and spreadsheets:

- Use headers and footers to keep documents organized.
- Maintain a consistent theme or style for readability and aesthetics.
- Include detailed captions for tables and figures to ensure they are understood in context.
- Set sections apart by using clear and significant demarcation.
