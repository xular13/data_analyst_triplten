# Project

**DATASET**

[Dataset: /datasets/squirrel_diet.csv]

Well done learning about seaborn and plotly. These libraries are extremely versatile with a wide range of functions and parameters. While we’ve only just scratched the surface, you should now be comfortable navigating both of these libraries for your future work, or personal projects. If you find yourself needing to do something beyond what has been covered, both libraries have great documentation of all of their functions.

For your final project we’ve provided you with a dataset and a figure. Your job is to use either seaborn or plotly to recreate the figure using the dataset.

The dataset contains the results of a mock study where 100 red squirrels were given one of three different diets after weaning, and their full grown adult weights were recorded. The figure below displays the results of the study, and this is the figure that you need to recreate.

## Project guidelines

You may use either seaborn or plotly to create your figure — it’s your choice! When you are done, submit a Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` file that contains both your code and the figure it produces. The reviewer will run your code and compare your figure to ours.

Take care to recreate the figure as closely as possible, which entails the same:

- Title and axis labels
- Axis ticks and ranges
- Legend
- Magenta and green data points (colors don’t need to be exact)
- Grouping and presentation of the data

Other figure elements, such as font size and style or image size, can be whatever you choose.

You’ll need to use a combination of functions and parameters that you’ve learned in this course, along with some that you didn’t. Use the official documentation or search the internet for how to do certain things that weren’t explicitly covered in the course, such as setting the X-axis data order. This is an important component of the project! In your work as a data professional, you’ll need to be able to use the knowledge you already have to figure out how to accomplish tasks that differ slightly from things you’ve already done.

Also note that there is more than one solution to this project. Of course, your code will depend on whether you choose to use seaborn or plotly. But even within one library, there are different ways to produce the same figure.
